# vehicle-accident-severity-prediction

This project is about vehicle accident severity prediction based on environmental stimuli using machine learning. In other words, I looked at weather-related data to understand its impact on potential car accident severity and built a prediction algorithm.

I used a data set titled "A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset" which you can find here:
